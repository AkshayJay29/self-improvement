# First Class

![First Class mockup images](assets/images/IMG_1145.jpg)


First Class is a fictional community of people looking to get in better-shape and become a first-class individual. It is situated in the centre of London- an area that is easily accessible from many areas. The two locations of St.James Park and Hilton Hotel allows you to not just enjoy the services and training, but to also enjoy the scenery, as the locations are very developed, and filled with high quality equipment.  


The purpose of this website is to promote First Class and to provide information to the customers about the training, session times and contact options. The website targets an audience of new customers looking for the training being offered as well as returning customers looking to schedule new appointments or find out more about the benefits they receive from our training. .
